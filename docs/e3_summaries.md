# #e3 Summaries - Planning and Strategy

## Manual Capture Prompt
- **Prompt**: "Condense this detailed description into a succinct summary, retaining the main facts and key details, and omitting unnecessary elaboration to create a compact overview."
- **Process**: After a #e3 chat, the condensed summary will be provided in the format below. Copy the summary and paste it into this file.

## Summaries

- **Summary**: Plan to automate Git processes for future projects to streamline setup (not now, but soon). Noted uncertainty about `setup_project.py` in the `4feaA9I` commit; suggested checking with `git show`. Proposed creating a mini chat state for #e1–#e5 to track debugging (#e1) in real time, summarizing key points with “My Thoughts,” and condensing using a custom prompt for #e1 chats. Suggested storing condensed #e1 summaries in `state.json` or a development log to retain critical project impacts. Emphasized keeping the approach simple, modular, and action-based, aiming to reset to `4feaA9I` and start a standalone `TestProject` next.

- **Summary**: Suggested semi-automating #e3 capture by providing a condensed summary at the end of each #e3 chat, which can be copied and pasted into `e3_summaries.md`. Added the manual capture prompt to `e3_summaries.md` to document the process. Plan to improve automation later.
